# EC500 Code Analysis

   ### Part 1
    
The file, CodeAnalysis.md, analyses my partner's code in depth, going over syntax, error handling, API call, cleanliness, and the accuracy of execution.
testcases.py will run the python script (re-named testtwitter2.py) with three test cases: 
  1. Non-existent Twitter Handle
  2. Twitter Handle with no photos
  3. Unrecognisable .json file or twitter credentials
  
Finally, I have suggested improvements, on my partner's github, labeled as issues for each missing section that I was able to discover. To view this, go to: https://github.com/WeiXinqiao/EC500_C1/tree/master/HW1_API


   ### Part 2:
    
In order to create a local website, I used the library *flask*, and displayed the necessary information on http://localhost:5000/ .

The following cases were tested:
1. Time it takes to execute the file
2. The google cloud vision labels
3. Invalid Username Case



   ### Aside:

The file **flasktest.py** is simply to test if the flask library works. Refer to **flask.py** for the actual main code.
